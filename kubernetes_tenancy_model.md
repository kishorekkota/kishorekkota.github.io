In this document, we will conduct a comprehensive comparison of different Tenancy Models for Kubernetes clusters. This analysis is particularly useful when these clusters are utilized across various product teams within an enterprise setting.

In the following sections, we will define Cluster Operating model.

### Operating Model # 1

In this model a single cluster is used for the enterprise workload for a given environment.

- A cluster for Production Environment. 
- A namespace for each Product team deploying workloads.
- A shared control plane and data plane for all workloads.


### Operating Model # 2

In this model a separate cluster is used for each product team workload for a given environment. 

- A cluster for each Product Team environment.




### Comparison of Operating Models

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Cluster Usage | Single cluster for enterprise workload | Separate cluster for each product team |
| Namespace Usage | Namespace for each product team | Not required |
| Control and Data Plane | Shared for all workloads | Separate for each team |
| Performance | Depends on the workload. Can be high if resources are properly managed | Can be controlled and optimized per team |

### Management of Clusters

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Cluster Management | Centralized management can be challenging with increasing workloads | Easier as each team manages their own cluster |
| Resource Allocation | Needs careful management to avoid resource contention | Easier as resources are isolated per team |
| Security | Requires strict RBAC policies for each namespace | Simplified as each team has its own cluster |
| Cost | Can be cost-effective if resources are properly utilized | Can be higher as each team needs a separate cluster |

### Networking Comparison

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Network Policies | Need to be carefully managed to avoid conflicts between namespaces | Simplified as each team has its own network in their cluster |
| Ingress/Egress Control | More complex due to shared network resources | Easier as each team controls their own network resources |
| Service Discovery | Can be complex due to shared services across namespaces | Simplified as services are isolated per team |
| Load Balancing | Shared load balancer can be a bottleneck | Each team can manage their own load balancing |


### Latency Comparison

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Latency | Can be high due to shared resources and potential for contention | Can be lower as resources are isolated per team |
| Latency (Cross-cluster Integration) | Can be high due to network overhead of cross-cluster communication | Can be lower as each team's workloads are within a single cluster |

### Deployment Complexity

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Deployment Complexity | Can be high due to shared resources and need for careful coordination | Simplified as each team manages their own deployments |
| Cross-team Coordination | Required for shared resources and to avoid conflicts | Not required as each team operates independently |
| Rollback Complexity | Can be high due to shared resources and potential impact on other teams | Simplified as each team manages their own rollbacks |

### Cost

| Criteria | Operating Model #1 | Operating Model #2 |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Infrastructure Cost | Can be lower as resources are shared across teams | Can be higher as each team needs their own dedicated resources |
| Management Cost | Can be higher due to the need for centralized management and coordination | Can be lower as each team manages their own resources |
| Overhead Cost | Can be higher due to potential for resource contention and inefficiencies | Can be lower as resources are isolated and can be optimized per team |
