### Context 

In this blog we will talk about all the steps involved with building an Agentic APP using Vertex AI.

An Agentic AI App is something that can make decisions, plan and adapt to new information real time. We will use this conepts to build an AI Agent that can discover API specification and respond to questions as an interactive virtual agent.


## Prerequisites

- A Hoverfly Instance to Simulate API interactions.
- Vertex AI - we discover more on what is needed off of Vertex AI.
- May be many more ( We will figure it out)

## Steps for Hoverfly

Prepare you simulation config file.
