Great, I’ll put together a technical white paper targeted at teams in the financial industry. It will cover how to build a call prediction system using memo/notes data, transactional data from APIs, and IVR exit intents. I’ll include prompt construction with few-shot examples, integrate prompt management and observability tooling (using COTS solutions), and provide diagrams and Python code samples where helpful. I’ll let you know when the white paper draft is ready for your review.

# LLM-Powered Call Prediction System for Financial Services

## System Architecture

 ([image]()) *Figure 1: High-level architecture of the call prediction system integrating enterprise data sources, IVR, and an LLM engine. Dashed boxes group components into Enterprise Systems (left), the Call Prediction Engine (center), and the Contact Center environment (right).* 

The proposed system architecture consists of three main layers (see **Figure 1** above): **(a)** Enterprise data sources (backend notes/memos databases, transaction data stores, etc.), **(b)** a *Call Prediction Engine* that orchestrates data retrieval, prompt construction, and LLM interactions, and **(c)** the contact center interfaces (IVR system and agent desktop). When a customer call begins, the IVR system attempts to gather the caller’s intent (through speech or DTMF input). If the IVR cannot fully resolve the issue, it exits with an *intent label* (e.g. *“lost card”* or *“billing issue”*) and transfers the call to a human agent. At this transfer moment, the Call Prediction Engine is triggered: it pulls relevant customer data (recent call notes, account transactions, profile events) from enterprise systems via APIs and combines it with the IVR’s identified intent (if available) to construct a prompt for the LLM. This prompt is sent to the LLM prompt-processing engine, which returns a predicted call reason and/or a recommended resolution. The prediction can then be displayed on the agent’s desktop as real-time assistance or, alternatively, fed back into an IVR/self-service workflow for automated resolution if confidence is high.

This architecture follows a *retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)* pattern, where internal data is injected into the LLM’s context to ground its output in up-to-date, customer-specific information ([What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? A Practical Guide](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation#:~:text=Retrieval,more%20informed%20and%20reliable%20responses)) ([What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? A Practical Guide](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation#:~:text=,data%20from%20company%20knowledge%20bases)). In essence, the LLM is augmented with “fresh, trusted data retrieved from authoritative internal knowledge bases and enterprise systems” ([What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? A Practical Guide](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation#:~:text=Retrieval,more%20informed%20and%20reliable%20responses)) – here, the bank’s notes and transaction records – to generate a more informed prediction. An orchestrator component (the Call Prediction Engine) sits in the middle as a mediator; this design is analogous to how enterprise “AI assistant” layers work in products like Microsoft’s Copilot for Customer Service, which *accesses CRM data and a semantic index for context before sending a prompt to the LLM* ([Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service architecture - Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/dynamics365/guidance/reference-architectures/dynamics-365-customer-service-copilot-architecture#:~:text=1,Copilot%20sends%20the%20response)). Similarly, BMC’s HelixGPT architecture introduces an Assistant service that brokers data and prompts between internal systems and the LLM ([BMC HelixGPT architecture - BMC Documentation](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/Service-Management/Employee-Digital-Workplace/BMC-HelixGPT/HelixGPT/Getting-started/Key-concepts/BMC-HelixGPT-architecture/#:~:text=Assistant)). By interfacing with core banking systems (for memos, transactions) through APIs, the engine can enrich the LLM prompt with domain-specific context (account events, recent issues, etc.), greatly improving the relevance of the LLM’s prediction.

From a networking perspective, all integrations can be done over secure channels (e.g. HTTPS for API calls and LLM endpoint requests). In a cloud deployment (such as using Azure OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock for the LLM), the bank’s backend systems would connect through a middleware layer that ensures data is encrypted in transit and that sensitive fields are masked or tokenized as needed. Many financial institutions adopt a hybrid approach – keeping sensitive data on-premise or in a private cloud, while leveraging LLMs with retrieval augmentation so that no raw confidential data is exposed in the prompt ([Practical Guide for LLMs in the Financial Industry | Automation Ahead Series](https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/the-automation-ahead-content-series/practical-guide-for-llms-in-the-financial-industry#:~:text=how%20these%20models%20can%20enhance,specific%20applications)) ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L80%20call%20drivers,tuning%20when%20applications)). In practice, this could mean using an on-premises LLM (or one in a virtual private cloud) if regulations require it, or using a third-party LLM with only non-PII, abstracted features of the data. (For example, the system might send “Transaction of \$5,000 on 2025-04-20 at Electronics World” instead of actual account numbers). The architecture should be designed with these security checkpoints, given the strict compliance environment of finance ([Generative AI in IVR Systems: Features, Benefits & Best P...](https://www.teneo.ai/blog/ultimate-guide-to-integrating-generative-ai-in-ivr-systems-features-benefits-and-best-practices#:~:text=Enhanced%20Data%20Security%20and%20Compliance)).

Key goals of this architecture are to **increase call containment and reduce handling time**. By predicting the call reason accurately and either automating the answer or arming the agent with immediate context, the system can improve first-call resolution rates. In contact center terminology, *containment rate* refers to the fraction of calls handled without human intervention ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=accessibility%20have%20facilitated%20their%20integration,prerequisite%20to%20optimize%20CC%20operations)). A well-integrated LLM solution can boost containment (deflect routine calls to self-service) and assist agents to speed up resolutions ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=accessibility%20have%20facilitated%20their%20integration,prerequisite%20to%20optimize%20CC%20operations)). As an example, an analysis by Cisco found that recognizing frequent call drivers (reasons) is critical to optimizing contact center operations with LLMs ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=objectives%3A%201,prerequisite%20to%20optimize%20CC%20operations)). In our architecture, the LLM’s prediction could be used to route the call to a specialized team or invoke an automated workflow. For instance, if the LLM predicts “customer likely calling to dispute a credit card late fee”, the system might proactively waive the fee (policy permitting) or present the agent with a one-click waiver option, thus resolving the issue swiftly. Banks and financial service providers adopting such AI-assisted call routing have reported improved customer satisfaction and lower average call duration ([Streamlining Customer Issue Resolution with LLMs | Terazo](https://terazo.com/streamlining-customer-issue-resolution-with-llms/#:~:text=Efficient%20call%20routing%20matches%20customer,decreases%20the%20average%20call%20duration)) ([Streamlining Customer Issue Resolution with LLMs | Terazo](https://terazo.com/streamlining-customer-issue-resolution-with-llms/#:~:text=Recent%20advancements%20in%20Natural%20Language,and%20improves%20overall%20agent%20productivity)). In summary, the architecture connects **data -> insight -> action**: it funnels raw data from disparate systems into an LLM, which generates a conversational insight, and that insight is turned into a helpful action for either an automated service or a human agent.

## Data Preparation Pipeline

The data preparation pipeline is responsible for fetching, cleaning, and blending data from multiple sources into a coherent prompt for the LLM. This pipeline operates in real-time (triggered when a call is initiated or an IVR transfer happens) and must complete within a short span (e.g. a few hundred milliseconds to a couple seconds) to keep call handling responsive. The key data inputs are:

- **Call Notes / Memos:** These are unstructured text notes from prior customer interactions, typically stored in a CRM or core banking system. They might include an agent’s notes from previous calls (e.g. *“Jan 5: Customer complained about credit card late fee; advised to pay minimum to avoid further fees”*). Such notes often contain abbreviations, typos, or internal jargon. The pipeline should cleanse this text – for example, removing agent names or IDs, standardizing terminology (mapping slang or acronyms to standard terms), and filtering out irrelevant content. In some cases, the notes may be very lengthy or contain multi-threaded history; it could be useful to summarize or extract the most recent and relevant parts. Techniques like named entity recognition (to pick out important entities like “late fee” or product names) or even a smaller NLP model to summarize the last few interactions can be applied before including notes in the prompt. The final cleaned notes might be a few sentences focusing on recent customer complaints or promises made. This ensures the LLM isn’t distracted by superfluous text.

- **Transaction Posting Data:** This refers to recent account transactions or ledger entries that could explain the customer’s reason for calling. In a banking context, these might be deposit postings, fee assessments, large withdrawals, loan payment postings, credit card charges, etc. The pipeline could query the transactions API for, say, the last 7-14 days of activity or any transactions above a certain dollar threshold in the past month. The raw data is structured (dates, amounts, descriptions). We may format a subset of this data into a human-readable form for the prompt (for example: *“Recent notable transactions: Apr 20 – \$5000 withdrawal (ATM), Apr 18 – \$35 overdraft fee, Apr 15 – \$1200 deposit”*). Not every transaction is relevant to the call – a heuristic or business rule can be used to filter these. For instance, fees, reversals, or failed transactions are high-value signals that often lead to calls. Domain knowledge can guide which transaction types to highlight (a sudden overdraft, a fee charged, a declined payment, etc., are likely call drivers in retail banking). The pipeline might ignore routine transactions and focus on anomalies or those matching the IVR intent (if the IVR said “dispute a charge”, then definitely include the recent charges).

- **IVR Exit Intent:** If the IVR system uses speech recognition or DTMF menus to capture the reason the customer is calling, it will pass an *intent* or a short transcript along with the call. For example, the IVR might have a natural language front-end that hears the customer say, “I want to know why I was charged a fee,” and it classifies this as `intent: fee_inquiry`. This information is extremely useful and should be incorporated into the prompt. The pipeline can take the IVR’s output (which might be a code or a phrase) and turn it into a concise statement. If the IVR intent is deemed confident (many IVR systems provide a confidence score), we can treat it as a strong hint to focus the LLM. For example: *“IVR detected intent: credit card late fee inquiry.”* If the IVR did not capture any intent (e.g. the system wasn’t sure or the customer just pressed 0 repeatedly), then this part might be omitted or set as “Intent: Unknown”. The pipeline must be robust to either case. When available, IVR context provides an excellent head start – it effectively is a *user query* in the user’s own words, which the LLM can use alongside backend data.

- **Other Contextual Data:** Depending on the financial institution, there may be other sources: e.g. recent support tickets, online banking messages, or profile changes. For instance, if a customer just changed their address online, they might be calling to confirm it or because they encountered an issue. If a fraud alert was triggered on the account, that’s vital context (the customer could be calling about a locked card). The pipeline can be extended to fetch such signals (fraud alerts, recent online banking secure messages, loan application status, etc.). Each source should be normalized to a short summary if included.

Once these data points are retrieved and cleaned, the pipeline merges them into a single prompt input. A straightforward approach is to create a structured text block with clear sections, for example:

```
Customer Profile ID: 123456789

Recent Agent Notes:
- Jan 5, 2025: Customer was charged a $35 late fee on credit card. She was upset and requested a waiver. Advised her of policy and to pay minimum to avoid further fees.
- Oct 10, 2024: Inquired about new card activation; resolved.

Recent Transactions:
- Apr 18, 2025: $35.00 Credit Card Late Fee applied
- Apr 10, 2025: $500.00 Payment received for Credit Card
- Mar 22, 2025: $35.00 Late Fee (previous cycle)

IVR Stated Intent: "late fee charge dispute"

Task: Based on the above notes and account activity, predict the most likely reason for the customer's call and suggest an appropriate resolution.
```

In this example format, the prompt is giving the LLM structured context: a snippet of notes, a list of transactions, and the IVR intent in quotes (possibly the actual phrase from the caller). The *Task* or instruction at the end tells the LLM what we want (the prediction and suggestion). The exact formatting can be tuned – the key is to provide a **concise, relevant summary** of the multi-modal data we have. 

During data preparation, special care should be taken regarding **data sensitivity and compliance** (especially for financial data). Personally identifiable information (PII) such as full account numbers, addresses, or social security numbers should typically not be exposed in the prompt to a third-party LLM. If using an external LLM API, the pipeline might mask such details (e.g. only show last 4 digits of an account, or use “John Doe” instead of the real name). This aligns with industry practices where *customer data is anonymized or tokenized before being sent to cloud services* ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L80%20call%20drivers,tuning%20when%20applications)). Additionally, the pipeline should enforce token limits – LLMs like GPT-4 have input size limits, so if the assembled data context is too large (say the customer has a very long history), the pipeline must truncate less important parts. One strategy is *input compression*: for example, if there are 20 past notes, summarize them into 2-3 bullet points, or if there are dozens of transactions, include only the 5 most relevant ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=Finally%2C%20we%20demonstrate%20how%20efficient,tuning%2C%20input%20compression%2C%20and)). By doing this preprocessing, we ensure the prompt stays within the model’s context window and focuses on information that will actually help the prediction.

Another aspect of preparation is formatting for clarity. The above example uses a simple text format; alternatively, we could feed the data in a structured JSON and prompt the LLM to output JSON. For instance, the prompt could literally be a JSON object:
```json
{
  "notes": ["2025-01-05: ...", "2024-10-10: ..."],
  "transactions": [
      {"date": "2025-04-18", "description": "Late Fee", "amount": 35.00},
      {"date": "2025-04-10", "description": "Credit Card Payment", "amount": -500.00},
      ...
  ],
  "ivr_intent": "late fee charge dispute"
}
```
…and then ask the LLM: *“Given this JSON data about the customer, what is the call likely about and what should we do?”*. Some LLMs handle structured input well, especially if prompted with a system message like *“You will be given customer data in JSON. Extract insights and answer the query.”* However, not all LLMs have reliable JSON parsing in their prompts unless fine-tuned for it, so many implementations keep to a natural text format. The guiding principle is to **preserve context and factual details** from the source data in a digestible way for the LLM. By doing so, we “augment” the LLM’s knowledge with real-time customer-specific info, which is exactly how RAG-based systems ensure accuracy and relevance ([What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? A Practical Guide](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation#:~:text=The%20retrieval%20model%20accesses%2C%20selects%2C,LLM%20AI%20learning%20in%20action)).

To summarize the pipeline steps in order:

1. **Trigger**: Receive a call event (e.g., IVR transfer or call start trigger) with a customer identifier and optional IVR intent.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Query internal systems via APIs (CRM, core banking, data warehouse) for recent notes, transactions, and any other contextual data (e.g., last IVR logs, recent alerts). Each query runs in parallel to minimize latency.
3. **Cleaning & Filtering**: For each data type, clean the text (remove sensitive info, correct obvious typos, standardize terms). Filter out irrelevant records (e.g., routine transactions) using business rules or simple NLP filters. If data volume is large, truncate or summarize it.
4. **Merge & Format**: Integrate the cleaned data points into a structured prompt string (or object). Ensure the format clearly labels each section (using headings like “Recent Transactions:” or bullets) so the LLM can distinguish them. Insert the IVR intent and possibly a direct question or instruction at the end of the prompt.
5. **Output**: Pass the final prepared prompt to the LLM interface (the next stage of the system). Log the prepared prompt (for debugging/audit) if needed, and handle any errors (e.g., if an API was down and data is missing, decide a fallback – maybe proceed with what’s available or default to just using IVR text).

The outcome of this pipeline is a single, coherent prompt that encapsulates the customer’s recent history and current context. By automating this data aggregation and formatting, we relieve the human agent from having to manually dig through multiple screens and notes while the customer is on the line. In the financial sector, where data may reside across legacy systems, a well-engineered pipeline is crucial to bring the right information together. Techniques like RAG explicitly *“retrieve structured data from enterprise systems and unstructured data from knowledge bases, transforming it into enriched, context-aware prompts”* ([What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? A Practical Guide](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation#:~:text=,data%20from%20company%20knowledge%20bases)) – our pipeline is a concrete implementation of that concept for call prediction.

## Prompt Engineering

Constructing effective prompts for the LLM is at the heart of this system’s success. Prompt engineering involves designing the input query (including context and instructions) such that the LLM understands the task and produces an accurate, useful result. In this call prediction use-case, the prompt includes the customer context (from the data pipeline) plus an instruction to the model to output the likely call reason and/or recommended action. Several best practices and advanced strategies can be applied here, notably **few-shot examples**, structured templates, and careful wording to preserve context and intent.

**Few-Shot Prompting:** Few-shot prompting means we provide the LLM with one or more examples of the task *within* the prompt itself, before asking it to perform the task on the real input ([Few-Shot Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot#:~:text=Few,the%20model%20to%20better)). This leverages the model’s in-context learning ability. For example, we might prepend to the prompt a made-up scenario as a demonstration:

```
[Example]
Previous Notes: "2025-02-10: Card reported lost; new card issued."
Recent Transactions: "2025-03-01: $200 ATM withdrawal; 2025-03-02: Card purchase declined."
IVR Intent: "card not working"

Assistant Conclusion: The customer likely received their new card but it’s not activated, causing declines. They are calling to activate or troubleshoot the new card.

---

[Current Customer]
Previous Notes: "2025-01-05: Late fee charged on credit card; customer unhappy..."
Recent Transactions: "2025-04-18: $35 Late Fee; 2025-04-10: $500 Payment..."
IVR Intent: "late fee charge dispute"

Assistant Conclusion:
```

In the above prompt structure, we gave a simplified example of another customer (with notes, transactions, IVR intent, and an “Assistant Conclusion”). Then we separated with a delimiter and provided the current customer’s data. This way, the LLM sees an example of the kind of reasoning and output we expect. The few-shot example should be representative of the actual task and ideally include the format we want in the answer. In this case, we show the model that the conclusion should include both an identification of the reason (“new card not activated causing declines”) and recognition of what the customer is likely calling about (“calling to activate or troubleshoot”). The model will then mimic this style for the real data. Few-shot prompting has been shown to significantly improve output quality without any model fine-tuning ([Few-Shot Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot#:~:text=Few,the%20model%20to%20better)) – it’s essentially teaching by example within the prompt.

When designing few-shot examples for a financial call center scenario, it’s important to cover a couple of typical call reasons (lost card, fee dispute, balance inquiry, fraud alert, etc.) as examples, but keep it concise (each example maybe 3-5 lines of data and a short conclusion). Also, we ensure our examples do not accidentally use actual customer data – they should be fictional or sanitized, to avoid data leakage or compliance issues.

**Prompt Templates and Structure:** Using a consistent template for the prompt helps maintain reliability. As seen, a template might have sections: one for notes, one for transactions, one for IVR, and then an instruction. We should decide on a style – either conversational (“Here is some information… What is the caller likely calling about?”) or directive (“Analyze the following data and output the call reason.”). A clear directive in system or user message often helps. For instance, if using an OpenAI Chat API, one could set up the messages like:

- **System message:** “You are an AI assistant for a bank’s call center. Your job is to analyze customer account activity and previous call notes to predict why the customer is calling and suggest a resolution. Be concise and factual.” 
- **User message:** (Then insert the structured data and question as constructed above).

By giving a system role, we prime the model with the appropriate persona and objectives (here, an assistant that only gives relevant call reasons and resolution). The user message carries the actual data and question. This split is useful in chat-oriented LLMs (like GPT-4, which uses system messages for instructions). 

We also might instruct the model on format: for example, we might want the output in a specific format such as a JSON with fields `"predicted_reason"` and `"suggested_action"`, or as bullet points. If so, include that in the prompt. E.g.: *“Respond in JSON with keys 'reason' and 'action'.”* However, models might not always perfectly follow format, so some post-processing or leniency is needed.

**Preserving Context and Avoiding Information Loss:** The prompt must preserve key context from the data preparation stage. It’s easy to inadvertently drop context if the prompt is poorly formatted. For example, if notes and transactions are jumbled together in a big paragraph, the model might mix them up or overlook something. Thus, using labels (e.g. "Notes:" vs "Transactions:") is helpful. We should also phrase the instruction to the LLM in a way that ties it to the context. Instead of a generic “Why is the customer calling?”, explicitly refer to the provided data: *“Based on the above notes and transactions, why is the customer calling and what is the best solution?”*. This makes it clear the answer should derive from the given context.

One challenge is ensuring the model doesn’t hallucinate extra details beyond the provided data. Financial data can be nuanced, and we only want the model to use what it has been given plus common sense. A good system message (as mentioned) can remind the model to stay factual and only use provided info. Additionally, the prompt might include a caution like: *“If unsure, respond with a likely reason but do not fabricate account details.”* Some LLMs allow a temperature parameter to control randomness; setting a relatively low temperature (e.g. 0.2-0.3) can make outputs more deterministic and closely tied to the input facts, which is useful for a prediction task that shouldn’t be wildly creative.

**Iterative Prompt Refinement:** In practice, one would iterate on the prompt design using real examples. You might test the prompt on historical cases: feed in known past scenarios and see if the LLM’s output matches the actual call reason. If not, refine wording or add an example. For instance, if the model tends to give very brief answers but you want more detail, you can adjust the prompt to say “Explain briefly the reason…”. Conversely, if the model is too verbose, instruct it to be concise or output just one sentence. 

**Example Prompt Construction:** Bringing it all together, a final prompt template might look like this (illustrating with a single-turn prompt for a completion-style API):

```
You are a financial services assistant that predicts why a customer is calling based on account data.

Customer ID: 123456

Recent Notes:
- 2025-01-05: Charged $35 late fee on credit card; customer requested waiver; advised to make minimum payment.
- 2024-12-22: Card reported stolen, new card issued.

Recent Transactions (last 30 days):
- 2025-01-02: $35.00 CREDIT CARD LATE FEE
- 2024-12-28: $500.00 CREDIT CARD PAYMENT
- 2024-12-25: $200.00 ATM WITHDRAWAL

IVR Stated Intent: "late fee inquiry"

Question: What is the most likely reason for the customer's call, and what should the bank do to resolve it?

Answer in 1-2 sentences.
```

In the above, the model sees a clear layout and the role it should play. The *Answer in 1-2 sentences* is a constraint to keep it focused. We might also prefer the model to answer in a certain tone (professional, empathetic). If needed, that can be in the system message: e.g. *“Respond in a polite and professional tone suitable for a customer service assistant.”* Tone is important in financial contexts – we likely want the answer to be calm and assuring, especially if the customer is upset about a fee.

**Few-shot vs. Zero-shot:** If the underlying LLM is very powerful (like GPT-4), a well-crafted zero-shot prompt (no examples, just instructions and data) might suffice in many cases. Few-shot examples are most useful if the task has some complexity or if using a smaller/less specialized model. They effectively reduce the ambiguity by showing exactly what to do ([Few-Shot Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot#:~:text=Few,the%20model%20to%20better)). In early testing, one can compare outputs with and without few-shot to decide if the added complexity is justified. Keep in mind few-shot examples eat into your token budget for the prompt, which in turn can increase latency and cost. So there’s a trade-off: use just enough prompting to get reliable results, but not so much that the prompt itself becomes bloated.

**Maintaining Context Across Calls (Multi-turn):** Our scenario is mostly single-turn per call (each call trigger generates one prompt and one prediction). However, if one were to integrate this into a conversational assistant that interacts with the customer in multiple turns (like a chatbot continuing the IVR conversation), one must preserve context across turns. In that case, the prompt engineering extends to maintaining a conversation history: the LLM’s answer can be fed back in as context for the next user question, etc. That is beyond the core “prediction” use-case, but it’s worth noting that similar principles apply – the conversation history acts like the “notes” and must be included in subsequent prompts. In an agent-assist scenario, it could be that the agent asks follow-up questions to the assistant (LLM) – e.g. “Did we waive the last fee?” – which means the architecture could support interactive querying of the LLM. For our scope, we focus on the single-turn prediction, but designwise we ensure the prompt construction is encapsulated such that it could be called repeatedly in a conversation loop if needed.

**Template Versioning:** As we refine the prompt template, we should version-control it (which leads into the next section on prompt management). In a bank’s production system, any changes to the prompt wording or examples should be tested and documented. It’s helpful to maintain a few variants and note which one performs best, since sometimes a slight rephrase can change model behavior. For instance, whether we ask “What is the reason?” vs “Why do you think the customer called?” might yield different styles of answers. Systematically experimenting and locking in the best template will be part of the engineering process.

In summary, prompt engineering for this system entails providing clear, contextual, and guided input to the LLM. Techniques like few-shot prompting serve to *“explain our intent to the model by demonstration”* ([Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#:~:text=Prompt%20Engineering%20,words%2C%20describe%20the%20task)), thereby improving its responses. A stable template ensures consistency, and careful instructions mitigate the risk of the model going off-track. By investing effort in this prompt design phase, we effectively teach the LLM to become a savvy call prediction agent that understands financial context and produces actionable insights.

## Prompt Management and Observability

Once the system is up and running, managing prompts and monitoring the LLM’s behavior becomes critical. In an enterprise setting (especially in finance), we need robust **prompt management** (version control, testing, and rollout of prompt changes) and **observability** (tracking what prompts were sent, what responses were received, how the model is performing over time). There are several commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions and open-source tools that cater to *LLM Ops* – analogous to MLOps but focused on prompt-driven AI systems.

**Prompt Versioning & Experimentation:** During development, we might try variations of prompts or few-shot examples. It's important to track these versions. Tools like *PromptLayer* and *LangSmith* allow teams to store and compare prompt templates, along with the model’s responses for each ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=LLMs%20blog,the%20lifecycle%20of%20LLM)). For example, PromptLayer provides a visual interface to organize prompts, edit versions, and even perform A/B tests between prompt variants ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=Services%3A)). This means we can deploy Prompt Template v1 and v2 to two subsets of traffic and see which yields more accurate predictions (comparing outcomes). *Mirascope* is another tool that, while primarily a toolkit for building LLM apps, supports defining prompts programmatically and testing them, even enabling chain-of-prompts and structured output validation ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=Services%3A)) ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=LLM%20calls%20together%2C%20enabling%20complex,output%20structures%3A%20Mirascope%20provides%20tools)). Whichever tool is used, the goal is to avoid the chaos of ad-hoc prompt tweaks – instead, treat prompt changes like code: use version control, have a review process, and roll back if needed. Since LLMs can be sensitive to wording, a centralized prompt registry ensures everyone (developers, data scientists, ops) knows which prompt is live and can trace changes if something goes wrong.

**Outcome Tracking:** We not only want to track the prompts and responses, but also the *outcomes*. In this call prediction scenario, the “ground truth” outcome might be what the call actually turned out to be (as logged by the agent or system). For instance, if the agent selects an actual call reason code in a CRM after the call, we want to record that and compare it to the LLM’s predicted reason. COTS solutions might not automatically know the ground truth, but we can instrument our system to capture it. For example, we could log an event: `prediction=fee_dispute, actual=fee_dispute` or `prediction=card_issue, actual=fraud_alert`. Over time, we accumulate a dataset of predictions vs actual outcomes. This is invaluable for evaluation (which we’ll discuss in the next section) and for spotting drift (maybe the model starts getting a certain category wrong consistently). A prompt management tool can store metadata or tags with each prompt-response entry ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=With%20PromptLayer%2C%20your%20team%20can,Frontier%20LLMs)), so we could tag it with things like `call_id`, `customer_segment`, and later attach the actual result.

**Monitoring Model Behavior:** LLMs can occasionally produce errors or unexpected outputs (for example, if our prompt wasn’t clear, it might give an overly verbose answer or misinterpret something). We need to monitor for **correctness, performance, and security** issues. Key aspects to watch:

- **Latency and Throughput:** How long each LLM API call takes and how many calls are being handled. We can log timestamps around the LLM invocation to measure latency per request. If using an observability platform, many provide this automatically. *PromptLayer*, for instance, tracks request execution times and can display latency trends ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=,trends%2C%20and%20manage%20execution%20logs)). This helps ensure we meet real-time requirements (if latency spikes, we might need to investigate – perhaps the prompt got too long or an upstream service is slow).
- **Token Usage and Cost:** LLM APIs often return usage info (# of prompt tokens and # of response tokens). Tracking this is important for cost management, especially at scale. A tool like PromptLayer or *Helicone* can aggregate usage across calls to show how costs are adding up, and identify which prompts are most expensive (maybe a certain type of call produces a very large prompt). Observability dashboards let you see average token usage per request over time ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=%28generating%20false%20information%29%20or%20biases,pinpoint%20the%20source%20of%20problems)) ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=improvement%20and%20ensures%20the%20LLM,lead%20to%20significant%20cost%20savings)). In finance, controlling cost is crucial for ROI – if we see cost per call is too high, we might decide to shorten the prompt or use a cheaper model for certain intents.
- **Errors and Failures:** Any failed API calls, timeouts, or exceptions should be logged. For example, if the LLM API returns an error (perhaps due to rate limiting or an invalid input token), the system should catch it and record the incident (maybe fallback to a default behavior too). Monitoring tools often have alerting; e.g., you could set an alert if error rate exceeds 1%. Ensuring high availability of the service might involve using a retry or a backup model if the primary fails.
- **Output Quality and Safety:** We should monitor what the LLM is outputting. Since this is an internal assistant (not directly user-facing in raw form), the risk is lower than a chatbot, but we still care about accuracy and any potentially problematic content. For example, if the LLM somehow outputs a sentence that includes something inappropriate or a data hallucination (e.g., “Your account has been hacked!” when it hasn’t), that would be bad. We can incorporate some automated checks on the outputs – e.g., run a simple regex or classifier on the LLM’s text to detect certain keywords or categories. There are also AI content moderation models that could flag if the LLM said something toxic or revealed PII. Observability tools might not do this out-of-the-box, but some platforms (like *Langfuse* or *TruLens*) are starting to include evaluation frameworks to grade outputs against expectations. In a bank’s case, *compliance* is a concern – we would monitor that the LLM isn’t making any unapproved statements (for instance, giving financial advice or guarantees outside its scope).
- **Prompt Injection or Security**: If the system were extended to take some user input, prompt injection (where a user says something that breaks the prompt pattern) could be an issue. In our current design, the user’s direct input is only through the IVR which we encapsulate, so it’s not as open-ended as a chatbot. Nonetheless, we might ensure the IVR text is sanitized (not containing something that could hijack the prompt). Security monitoring might include watching for anomalies in prompt content or spikes in usage that might indicate misuse. Logging and reviewing prompts periodically (with privacy in mind) can help spot if anything odd is being sent to the LLM.

**Tools for Observability:** As mentioned, there are many tools emerging. Here are a few notable ones and their relevance:

- **PromptLayer:** A dedicated prompt management and observability platform. It hooks into calls to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs and logs all prompts, responses, and metadata ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=PromptLayer%3A%20The%20Leading%20LLM%20Observability,Platform)). It offers prompt versioning, team collaboration (so prompts can be shared/tweaked with a UI), and searchability (find all prompts where a certain phrase was used, etc.). PromptLayer also tracks performance metrics like latency and token counts, and it even supports comparisons (A/B testing prompts) in a visual way ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=,members%20to%20easily%20work%20with)) ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=,popular%20LLM%20frameworks%20and%20abstractions)). This could be very useful for our use-case as we refine prompts over time.
- **LangSmith (LangChain):** LangSmith is LangChain’s tracing and observability tool ([Add observability to your LLM application | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/tutorials/observability#:~:text=into%20your%20application,is%20important%20throughout%20all)). If our implementation used LangChain to orchestrate the LLM calls, LangSmith can record each step, input, and output. It’s useful if we had a chain (like retrieval step + LLM step). It provides a trace view so you can debug where things might be slowing down or failing. Also supports dataset evaluation runs (feeding a test set of prompts and capturing all outputs for analysis).
- **Helicone:** An open-source proxy for OpenAI API that logs requests. Helicone can capture request/response and provides a dashboard with similar metrics (latency, tokens, etc.), basically a self-hosted alternative to something like PromptLayer.
- **Arize/Phoenix:** *Arize AI* (an ML observability company) has an open-source tool called Phoenix specifically for LLM monitoring ([List of top LLM Observability Tools](https://drdroid.io/engineering-tools/list-of-top-llm-observability-tools#:~:text=1,Datadog)). Phoenix can analyze embeddings of responses, detect outliers in model outputs, and help with troubleshooting why an LLM might be making certain mistakes. It’s more advanced in analyzing the *content* of responses at scale (e.g., clustering them to see distinct categories of responses).
- **TruLens (TruFeedback):** This focuses on feedback loops, where you can set up evaluation criteria for LLM outputs and get scores. For example, TruLens could be configured to measure whether the LLM’s predicted reason matches the actual reason (if we encode actual reason as a label and have an automated way to compare – even if approximate). This can give a real-time metric of “accuracy” that can be monitored.
- **Datadog / NewRelic / AppInsights:** Traditional APM (application performance management) tools can also be used. We can emit logs or metrics to such systems since at the end of the day this is a software service. For instance, log an event “LLM_call_duration=500ms, tokens_used=750” and have Datadog graph it. Custom dashboards could be built to monitor these metrics alongside other system metrics (CPU, memory, etc.). Some APM tools may not have LLM-specific features but can still track our service reliability.
- **Human Feedback Loops:** Beyond automated tools, we might incorporate human-in-the-loop oversight. For example, have call center QA staff review a sample of LLM suggestions vs actual outcomes to gauge if the prompts need adjusting. Or even allow agents using the system to click a “thumbs up/down” if the prediction was helpful, which we would collect and monitor.

Given the importance of tracking prompt effectiveness, prompt management tools emphasize *collaboration and version control* so that prompts become first-class artifacts in the development lifecycle ([Best Prompt Versioning Tools for LLM Optimization (2025)](https://blog.promptlayer.com/5-best-tools-for-prompt-versioning/#:~:text=%2A%20Team%20Collaboration%3A%20Allows%20non,to%20easily%20work%20with%20engineering)). In a bank, you might have compliance or business stakeholders who want to review how the AI is prompting (to ensure no misleading or biased language). A platform like PromptLayer could allow them to view the prompt templates in a friendly UI instead of digging through code.

Another aspect is **logging and data retention policies**. Financial institutions have strict rules on logging customer data. Even though we pass masked data to the LLM, the prompts and responses might still contain sensitive info (like “late fee on 04/18”). We must align with data retention policies – e.g., perhaps we can log prompts for debugging in non-prod, but in production, we might choose to hash or not log full content to avoid storing any PII. Some observability tools allow customizing what to log (for instance, log the prompt structure and metrics but not the raw values). This is a design decision that should involve the security team.

To illustrate how one might integrate an observability tool, here’s an example with PromptLayer in code (simplified):

```python
import promptlayer
import openai

# Set API keys for OpenAI and PromptLayer (would be loaded from secure config in practice)
openai.api_key = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
promptlayer.api_key = "<PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY>"

# Use PromptLayer's tracking by calling OpenAI through its client
response = promptlayer.openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a call prediction assistant for a bank."},
      {"role": "user", "content": assembled_prompt_text}
    ],
    temperature=0.3,
    pl_tags=["call_prediction", "prompt_v2.1"]
)
predicted_reason = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
usage = response['usage']
print("Model output:", predicted_reason)
print("Tokens used:", usage)
```

In the snippet above, `promptlayer.openai.ChatCompletion.create` acts as a drop-in replacement for `openai.ChatCompletion.create`, automatically logging the prompt, model, and tags we provided (like we tagged it with version 2.1 of our prompt template) ([Python - PromptLayer](https://docs.promptlayer.com/languages/python#:~:text=from%20promptlayer%20import%20PromptLayer%20promptlayer_client,PromptLayer)) ([Python - PromptLayer](https://docs.promptlayer.com/languages/python#:~:text=There%20is%20only%20one%20difference%E2%80%A6,group%20requests%20in%20the%20dashboard)). This call would be recorded in the PromptLayer dashboard, where we could later see the input and output, and the tags help filter or group them. We also print out token usage which OpenAI’s API returns (PromptLayer would also aggregate this on their side). In a real app, instead of printing, we’d perhaps send `usage` metrics to a monitoring service.

Another example using LangChain/LangSmith could involve wrapping our LLM call with tracing enabled:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.callbacks import tracing

# Initialize LangSmith tracing
tracing_enabled = True
if tracing_enabled:
    import os
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_HANDLER"] = "langchain"
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "CallPredictionProd"

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
with tracing(enabled=tracing_enabled) as session:
    prediction = llm(prompt_text)
```

This would send the trace (prompt and response) to the LangSmith backend configured for the project. The advantage is if our pipeline had multiple steps (say retrieval + LLM), all would appear in the trace timeline.

**In summary**, prompt management and observability ensure that after deploying the system, we maintain **control and insight** into its operation. We track prompts like code (using versioning and A/B testing to continuously improve), and we instrument the system to monitor key metrics (accuracy, latency, cost, etc.) ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=,Detailed%20logs%2C%20traces%2C%20and)) ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=improvement%20and%20ensures%20the%20LLM,Implementing)). This is especially important in the financial industry where oversight is mandatory. By using COTS tools specialized for LLMs (PromptLayer, LangSmith, Helicone, etc.), we can accelerate implementing these capabilities instead of building from scratch ([Best Tools for LLM Observability: Monitor & Optimize LLMs](https://blog.promptlayer.com/best-tools-to-measure-llm-observability/#:~:text=LLMs%20blog,the%20lifecycle%20of%20LLM)) ([List of top LLM Observability Tools](https://drdroid.io/engineering-tools/list-of-top-llm-observability-tools#:~:text=Top%20Tools%20to%20consider%20for,LLM%20Observability)). Ultimately, robust prompt management and monitoring will allow us to iterate safely, catch issues early (e.g., a prompt version that underperforms or a model drift), and give stakeholders confidence that the AI system is behaving as intended and delivering value.

## Implementation Examples (Python Code)

To solidify the concepts, this section provides code snippets that demonstrate how one might implement key parts of the call prediction system. These examples use Python, which is commonly used for such backend services in data engineering and machine learning workflows. We will go through: (a) ingesting data from various sources, (b) transforming and formatting that data into a prompt, (c) calling an LLM via an API, and (d) logging/observability instrumentation.

**1. Data Ingestion and Preparation**  
In a real system, data would be fetched from databases or APIs. Here we simulate it with predefined structures. We will assume we have functions or API clients to get notes and transactions. We also simulate an IVR intent coming in as input.

```python
# Simulated data retrieval (in reality, you'd call your DB/API here)
def get_recent_notes(customer_id, limit=3):
    # For example, fetch last 3 notes from CRM for this customer
    notes = [
        "2025-01-05: Late fee charged on credit card; customer requested waiver; advised to make minimum payment.",
        "2024-10-10: Customer inquired about new card activation; provided instructions.",
        "2024-07-20: Fraud alert on card; customer confirmed transactions."
    ]
    return notes[:limit]

def get_recent_transactions(customer_id, days=30):
    # Simulate transaction records as list of dicts or tuples
    transactions = [
        {"date": "2025-01-02", "description": "CREDIT CARD LATE FEE", "amount": 35.00},
        {"date": "2024-12-28", "description": "CREDIT CARD PAYMENT", "amount": -500.00},
        {"date": "2024-12-25", "description": "ATM WITHDRAWAL", "amount": -200.00}
    ]
    # In practice, filter by last `days` and return sorted by date desc.
    return transactions

# Example usage:
customer_id = "123456"
notes = get_recent_notes(customer_id)
transactions = get_recent_transactions(customer_id)
ivr_intent = "late fee inquiry"  # e.g., obtained from IVR system
```

In this snippet, `get_recent_notes` and `get_recent_transactions` are stand-ins for actual data access logic. We then have a `customer_id` (which would come from the call context) and retrieve the notes, transactions, and suppose the IVR intent was parsed as "late fee inquiry". The data is stored in Python lists/dicts.

Next, we’ll **clean and format** this data into a prompt string. We iterate over notes and transactions to create text blocks, and incorporate the IVR intent. We also add the instruction to the model at the end. For clarity, we’ll construct the prompt step by step.

```python
# Clean/format notes: join into a single string with bullets
note_lines = "\n".join(f"- {note}" for note in notes)

# Format transactions: join into a string
txn_lines = "\n".join(
    f"- {txn['date']}: ${txn['amount']:.2f} {txn['description']}"
    for txn in transactions
)

# Assemble the prompt
prompt_text = (
    "Recent Agent Notes:\n"
    f"{note_lines}\n\n"
    "Recent Transactions (last 30 days):\n"
    f"{txn_lines}\n\n"
)
if ivr_intent:
    prompt_text += f"IVR Stated Intent: \"{ivr_intent}\"\n\n"
# Add the question/instruction for the LLM
prompt_text += "Given the above, why is the customer calling and what is the recommended resolution?"

print(prompt_text)
```

Output from the `print(prompt_text)` might look like:

```
Recent Agent Notes:
- 2025-01-05: Late fee charged on credit card; customer requested waiver; advised to make minimum payment.
- 2024-10-10: Customer inquired about new card activation; provided instructions.
- 2024-07-20: Fraud alert on card; customer confirmed transactions.

Recent Transactions (last 30 days):
- 2025-01-02: $35.00 CREDIT CARD LATE FEE
- 2024-12-28: $-500.00 CREDIT CARD PAYMENT
- 2024-12-25: $-200.00 ATM WITHDRAWAL

IVR Stated Intent: "late fee inquiry"

Given the above, why is the customer calling and what is the recommended resolution?
```

Notice we included the `$` and formatted amounts nicely, and we put the IVR intent in quotes to indicate it’s a phrase from the customer. We also phrased the final question clearly. This prompt string is now ready to be sent to the LLM.

**2. Calling the LLM API**  
For calling an LLM, we can use an API like OpenAI’s. We’ll use the `openai` Python package in this example. In practice, you would handle authentication keys securely and possibly use an asynchronous call if this is in a web service context to avoid blocking the thread.

```python
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API (assumes OPENAI_API_KEY is set in environment or provided)
openai.api_key = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Choose model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) and call the completion API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful customer service assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt_text}
    ],
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=100  # limit the length of the answer
)

answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print("LLM Prediction:", answer)
```

This snippet constructs a chat-based API call. We gave a simple system prompt to set the assistant role (this could be more detailed as discussed earlier), and the user content is our compiled `prompt_text`. We set `temperature=0.3` for a more deterministic output and cap `max_tokens` so it doesn’t ramble on. The API returns a `response` dict, from which we extract the model’s answer. 

Suppose the model returns: *“The customer is likely calling to request a waiver of the $35 late fee on their credit card. The recommended resolution is to explain the fee, and if it’s a first offense, offer a one-time courtesy waiver.”* – That would be printed as the prediction. The calling code (which could be part of a web service in a real system) would then take this `answer` and pass it along to wherever it’s needed (e.g., display in agent UI or feed into an IVR text-to-speech).

**3. Utilizing Observability (Logging/Tracking)**  
We want to log relevant information about this LLM call. Even without fancy tools, we can log the prompt and response to a file or database for later analysis. However, as described earlier, using a service like PromptLayer can simplify tracking. Here’s how we might integrate PromptLayer to automatically log the request and response:

```python
import promptlayer

promptlayer.api_key = "<YOUR_PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY>"

# Wrap the OpenAI call with PromptLayer for logging
response = promptlayer.openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful customer service assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt_text}
    ],
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=100,
    pl_tags=["call_predict", f"intent:{ivr_intent or 'unknown'}"]
)

answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
usage = response['usage']
# Log/print usage metrics
print(f"Tokens [prompt+completion]: {usage['total_tokens']} (prompt {usage['prompt_tokens']}, completion {usage['completion_tokens']})")
```

By calling `promptlayer.openai.ChatCompletion.create`, this invocation (along with the `pl_tags` we provided) will be recorded on our PromptLayer dashboard ([Python - PromptLayer](https://docs.promptlayer.com/languages/python#:~:text=from%20promptlayer%20import%20PromptLayer%20promptlayer_client,PromptLayer)) ([Python - PromptLayer](https://docs.promptlayer.com/languages/python#:~:text=pl_tags%3D%5B%22getting)). We tagged it with `call_predict` and also an `intent:` tag that includes the IVR intent for filtering. We also captured `usage` – which might print something like *“Tokens [prompt+completion]: 147 (prompt 123, completion 24)”*. This tells us how large our prompt was and how long the answer was. We could decide to log this via Python’s logging facility as well:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='call_prediction.log', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info(f"[CallID:{customer_id}] Prompt Tokens={usage['prompt_tokens']}, Completion Tokens={usage['completion_tokens']}, IVR={ivr_intent}, PredictedReason={answer}")
```

This would append a line to `call_prediction.log` with key stats and the prediction. Over time, such logs build a trace of system behavior.

If we were using an asynchronous framework or microservice architecture, each call to the LLM might be an event we emit to a monitoring system. Many teams in practice send metrics to a system like CloudWatch, DataDog, or Splunk. For example, one might send a metric `model.latency` with the time taken, `model.tokens` with usage, and a log with the prompt ID and outcome. These can be later aggregated.

**4. Integration in a Web Service**  
While not shown in code here, it’s worth noting that these components would live inside a service (perhaps a Flask/FastAPI or a serverless function triggered by the telephony system). The overall flow is: Call comes -> IVR triggers prediction -> our code gathers data -> calls LLM -> returns prediction to caller (agent or system). The code structure might have an entry function like `def predict_call_reason(customer_id, ivr_intent)` that does steps 1-3 above and returns the `answer`. That function would be invoked by the telephony platform’s integration layer.

For completeness, here’s how one might tie everything together in a single function:

```python
def predict_call_reason(customer_id, ivr_intent=None):
    # 1. Fetch data
    notes = get_recent_notes(customer_id)
    txns = get_recent_transactions(customer_id)
    # 2. Prepare prompt text
    note_lines = "\n".join(f"- {n}" for n in notes)
    txn_lines = "\n".join(f"- {t['date']}: ${t['amount']:.2f} {t['description']}" for t in txns)
    prompt = f"Customer ID: {customer_id}\n"
    prompt += "Recent Notes:\n" + note_lines + "\n\n"
    prompt += "Recent Transactions:\n" + txn_lines + "\n\n"
    if ivr_intent:
        prompt += f"IVR Intent: \"{ivr_intent}\"\n\n"
    prompt += "Why is the customer calling and what should be done to help?"
    # 3. Call LLM
    response = promptlayer.openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # using a faster/cheaper model for example
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.4,
        pl_tags=["call_predict"]
    )
    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    # 4. Log some info
    usage = response.get('usage', {})
    logging.info({
        "customer_id": customer_id,
        "ivr_intent": ivr_intent,
        "prompt_tokens": usage.get('prompt_tokens'),
        "completion_tokens": usage.get('completion_tokens'),
        "prediction": answer
    })
    return answer
```

This function encapsulates the whole pipeline for a single call. It could be invoked like `pred = predict_call_reason("123456", ivr_intent="late fee inquiry")`. In a real application, you’d also have try/except blocks to handle exceptions (e.g., API failures) and maybe timeouts. You might also incorporate a cache – for example, if the same customer calls again soon, you could reuse some data to avoid hitting databases repeatedly in a short span. 

The Python examples above demonstrate a baseline implementation. In production, there are additional considerations such as concurrency (handling multiple calls at once), scaling the service (maybe containerizing and deploying to a cloud cluster), and optimizing for latency (perhaps preparing some data ahead of time if calls are predicted). Nonetheless, the core steps remain: **gather context, format prompt, call LLM, and handle the response**. The code pieces we’ve shown align directly with those steps and give a starting point that can be expanded with actual data source integrations and error handling.

## Evaluation and Performance Metrics

To ensure the call prediction system is effective and continually improving, we need to evaluate it using clear performance metrics. Evaluation should cover both **the quality of the predictions** (accuracy metrics) and **the operational performance** (latency, throughput, etc.). In the financial industry, any AI system should also be evaluated for compliance and fairness, but here we will focus on the performance related to call prediction outcomes. Below are key metrics and evaluation strategies:

**1. Prediction Accuracy and Precision:** The primary measure of success is how often the LLM’s predicted call reason matches the actual reason for the call. If the system predicts a category or specific issue, we can compare that to the post-call categorization done by the agent or by call logging systems. For evaluation, we can compute metrics like:
- *Accuracy:* The percentage of calls where the prediction was exactly correct. (e.g., in 100 tested calls, the AI correctly predicted 78 of them → 78% accuracy).
- *Precision and Recall:* If we consider each possible intent (fee dispute, card issue, fraud alert, etc.), we can compute precision (of the calls the AI predicted as “fraud alert”, what fraction were truly fraud issues) and recall (of all actual fraud issue calls, what fraction did the AI catch in advance). These are useful if we care more about some categories than others.
- *Top-N Accuracy:* Sometimes the system might output a primary guess and a secondary guess. If we allow multiple guesses, Top-N accuracy (did the correct reason appear in the top 2 or top 3 guesses) can be measured.
- *Deflection Precision:* If the system is used to automatically deflect some calls (for instance, if it’s very confident and resolves via IVR without agent), we need to ensure those deflections were appropriate. A metric here is: of the calls we attempted to handle with the AI prediction, how many were successfully resolved vs how many had to eventually involve an agent. This is basically measuring the precision of automation. We want a high success rate for any automated handling.

To calculate these, we need ground truth data. During a pilot, we could run the system in shadow mode (not actually intervening, just predicting) and manually label or use the agent’s eventual disposition as truth. For example, if for call #001 the AI predicted “late fee issue” but the agent notes show the customer actually called about fraud, that’s a false prediction. After collecting a sizable sample (say a few hundred calls), we can compute these stats. This provides a baseline to improve upon.

**2. Containment Rate (Call Deflection Rate):** *Containment rate* is a common call center metric – it is the fraction of calls that are fully handled by self-service (no human needed) ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=accessibility%20have%20facilitated%20their%20integration,prerequisite%20to%20optimize%20CC%20operations)). If our system is implemented in a way that feeds back to the IVR to handle the issue (for certain predictable scenarios), we can measure how much we improved containment. For instance, before the AI, maybe 10% of calls were handled in self-service; after deploying AI predictions to the IVR, it might handle 20% of calls without agent transfer. That increase (to 20%) is a direct ROI of the system. To evaluate this, we segment calls into those where the AI intervened vs not, and track resolution rates. We should be careful: containment is good only if the issue is actually resolved – if the IVR “thought” it solved it but the customer calls back or goes to an agent later, that’s not a true containment. So a high-quality evaluation includes checking if there was any repeat call or if the customer explicitly opted out to agent, etc.

**3. Reduction in Average Handle Time (AHT):** If the system is used for agent assist (the AI gives the agent a head-start), we expect the handle time of calls to drop. We can run an A/B test: one set of calls where agents have the AI suggestion, and a control set where they don’t. Measure the average call duration or the after-call work time. If the AI is helpful, agents should be able to resolve quicker (perhaps because they didn’t need to put the caller on hold to research the issue). For example, maybe average call time for fee disputes drops from 6 minutes to 4 minutes with the AI because the fee waiver process was immediately recommended. This metric ties to operational efficiency – lower AHT means cost savings and often higher customer satisfaction (less time on the phone). We should gather enough call samples to see a statistically significant difference. Call center analytics tools or workforce management systems can provide these AHT numbers per call type.

**4. First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** FCR is the percentage of issues resolved on the first call, without the customer needing to call back or escalate. A good prediction system might improve FCR by ensuring the agent (or IVR) addresses the real issue proactively. For example, if the AI predicts a likely secondary issue (“customer might also ask about recent overdraft”), the agent could answer that in the same call, preventing a call-back. Measuring FCR involves tracking if a customer calls again for the same issue within, say, 7 days. We compare FCR before and after system deployment. If the AI is doing well, FCR should increase (fewer repeat calls).

**5. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** These are more qualitative, but many banks survey customers after interactions. An AI that leads to quicker or correct resolutions could reflect in slightly higher CSAT scores. One might not attribute all changes to the AI, but it’s worth monitoring if there is an uptick in phrases like “The agent already knew what I needed – impressive!” in survey comments. Google Cloud noted that using Agent Assist (an AI help similar to this system) improves CSAT and NPS via reduced handling time and better answers ([How gen AI is transforming the customer service experience | Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-gen-ai-is-transforming-the-customer-service-experience#:~:text=Real,first%20step)). We can indirectly take that as a metric to watch. If possible, segment CSAT by call type to see if, for example, CSAT for fee dispute calls improved after AI was introduced (perhaps because those calls are resolved more empathetically and quickly with AI suggestions).

**6. Latency Metrics:** On the technical side, we need to ensure the system operates within acceptable time. Key metrics:
- *End-to-End Prediction Time:* from the moment a call arrives (or IVR hands off) to the moment the AI prediction is ready. If this is too slow, the agent might already be talking to the customer without the info. We likely want this under ~2 seconds, and the faster the better (sub-second would be ideal, though challenging with LLM calls). We can measure and average this. 
- *Breakdown of Latency:* how much time spent in data fetching vs prompt creation vs LLM API call. If LLM call is the majority (e.g. 1 second of data fetch + 1 second LLM = 2 sec total), that’s fine. If data fetch is slow (maybe one system took 5 seconds to respond), we identify that and can optimize (maybe cache or asynchronous fetch earlier). Logging timestamps in the pipeline helps with this breakdown.
- *Throughput/Scalability:* If the call center has, say, 100 calls starting per minute during peak, can our system handle 100 LLM requests per minute? This is more of a load test evaluation. If using an external API, we must ensure we won’t hit rate limits or we have sufficient throughput purchased. We might simulate a high volume with test calls to see where bottlenecks occur. A metric could be maximum calls per second handled without degradation.

**7. Model Performance and Drift:** Since we rely on an LLM (which might be updated by the provider or might “drift” in behavior slightly over time or as usage changes), we should track the model’s performance metrics over time. For example, track the prediction accuracy month by month. If we see it dropping, something might be off – maybe the model was updated or customer behavior changed (new kinds of calls after launching a new product that the model isn’t handling well). This ties into observability: we can periodically run evaluation datasets (a set of example calls with known outcomes) through the system and see how it performs. This sort of regression testing ensures that prompt changes or model updates don’t unknowingly degrade performance.

**8. Compliance and Error Analysis:** In finance, evaluating an AI system isn’t just about numbers. We should also do qualitative error analysis:
- Look at cases where the prediction was wrong and analyze why. Was it because the data was incomplete (maybe a missing note) or because the model misunderstood? This can guide improvements (maybe add another data field or tweak the prompt).
- Ensure that even when the AI is wrong, it’s not making a harmful suggestion. For example, a wrong prediction that still results in the agent double-checking and correcting is okay, but a wrong prediction that would have caused a wrong action (like waiving a fee that was actually valid or, worse, giving out info on the wrong account) is not acceptable. So far, our design doesn’t directly execute actions without human review (unless used in IVR with high confidence), which is safer. But if we automate actions, each automated decision must be evaluated for false positives.

**9. A/B Testing New Improvements:** When we introduce a new prompt version or an updated LLM model, we can use A/B testing as part of evaluation. Route some percentage of calls through the new version and compare metrics (accuracy, handle time, etc.) to the old version. For example, if OpenAI releases GPT-4.5, we might test it vs GPT-4 and see if prediction accuracy improves enough to justify any cost or performance differences. Having a robust evaluation framework with offline metrics plus online A/B tests is ideal.

**10. Business Impact Metrics:** Beyond technical accuracy, measure how this translates to business value:
- *Agent efficiency gain:* e.g., “agents handle 5 more calls per day on average due to reduction in research time.”
- *Cost savings:* e.g., “deflecting X% of calls saves \$Y per month in contact center costs.”
- *Upsell opportunities:* interestingly, if the AI can predict call reason, maybe it can also hint at next best action. Perhaps not in our scope, but banks might evaluate if AI suggestions led to any cross-sell (e.g., customer called about a fee, AI suggested offering a balance transfer promo which customer accepted). This could be another KPI if that was a goal.

For a concrete evaluation approach, imagine we use historical data: We take 1000 past call records (with notes, transactions, etc.) where we know the actual call reason (labeled by QA or by call coding). We run our pipeline offline on these 1000 cases and collect the AI’s predicted reason for each. Then:
- We calculate accuracy = (# correct predictions / 1000).
- We produce a confusion matrix: how often did it mistake one category for another.
- We identify any systematic errors (maybe it struggles with distinguishing “lost card” vs “fraud” because both involve card issues).
- We might find that with IVR intent included, accuracy is higher (we could test the pipeline with and without IVR data to quantify its benefit).

If accuracy is, say, 80% overall, we then decide if that’s sufficient to deploy and in what mode. Maybe we decide to fully automate deflection for the top 3 categories where it’s 95% accurate, but for others just use it as a hint to agents.

**Continuous Evaluation:** After deployment, set up a feedback loop. For instance, every week, compute the accuracy on that week’s calls (this is where logging prediction vs actual comes in handy). Track the trend. Also track how many times agents followed the AI suggestion vs went a different route (if we have that data, perhaps through a UI where agent can accept the suggestion). Agent feedback (if captured) can be part of evaluation too.

In terms of performance benchmarks, literature and case studies provide some targets: An AI-powered system by Cisco (call driver prediction) might aim for an accuracy significantly above a zero-shot baseline ([LLM-Based Insight Extraction for Contact Center Analytics and Cost-Efficient Deployment](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19090v1#:~:text=We%20selected%20two%20language%20models,utilizes%20a%20custom%20prompt%20design)). In their paper, GPT-3.5 had a certain performance and a fine-tuned model improved it, etc. We can draw inspiration: start with a baseline (maybe the IVR alone gets the intent right 60% of time; our LLM with data raises that to 85%). That improvement is our value add.

Finally, we should not forget **latency SLAs** – e.g., “95th percentile prediction time must be < 2 seconds.” We evaluate that by looking at logs or observability metrics over a month. If occasionally the LLM took 5 seconds (maybe due to network hiccup), consider if that’s acceptable or if we need a timeout mechanism.

In conclusion, a multifaceted evaluation should be in place:
- **Quality metrics:** accuracy, precision/recall per intent, containment rate, FCR.
- **Efficiency metrics:** call handle time, time-to-answer (latency).
- **Business metrics:** CSAT, cost savings.
- **Robustness metrics:** error rate of system, any security/compliance incidents (hopefully zero).

By continuously measuring these and comparing against targets, we can quantitatively assess the system. For example, we might set goals like *“Reduce fee-related call average duration by 20% within 3 months”* or *“Achieve prediction accuracy of >90% on top 5 call drivers”*. These goals drive further prompt tuning, model improvements, or additional training data for the LLM if necessary. Regular reports can be generated (possibly from the observability platform or custom analytics) to show stakeholders (like operations managers or compliance officers) how the system is performing. This kind of rigor in evaluation is essential in the financial industry, where any AI system would likely undergo scrutiny and require proof of its benefits and reliability. 

By adhering to these evaluation practices and metrics, we ensure the call prediction system not only works in theory but delivers tangible improvements in practice, all while maintaining the trust and satisfaction of both the customers and the agents who interact with it.
