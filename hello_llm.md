## Key Terminology

### Vector Embedding

Vector Embedding is a technique in machine learning and natural language processing to convert non numeric data types, such as words, sentences, or event tier document into numeric forms. Specially Vector of real numbers.

Key process with in Vector Embedding is to represent in a high dimensional space such as geometric relationship between these vectors capturing semantic relationship.

There are several methods and models for generating vector embedding - Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText among the most popular.

## What is Language Model vs Large Language Model ?


There are 2 key properties that distinguish LLms from other language models. One is Quantitative and the other is Qualitative.

- Quantitative; 10-1oo billion parameters.
- Qualitative; primarily lies in their scale, complexity, capabilities, and the resources required for their development and operation. Has enhanced capabilities that can support zero-shot learning which can generalize based on learning and can process unseen classes based on seen classes.


### What does an LLM do anyway ?

AN LLM task is to do word prediction. In other words, given a sentence or sequence of words, it needs predict next word.

Interestingly, this is the same way many Language Models have been trained in the past with GPT



# Implementing a Simple Language Model

## Step 1: Understand the Basics
- **Learn about NLP**: Understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **Study Language Models**: Familiarize yourself with language models, especially Transformer-based models like BERT, GPT-2, etc.

## Step 2: Choose a Framework
- **Select an ML Framework**: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch. Both are popular and well-supported.
- **Install Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries (like Hugging Face’s Transformers) installed.

## Step 3: Choose a Pre-trained Model
- **Start with a Pre-trained Model**: Choose a pre-trained model from Hugging Face’s model hub. Models like GPT-2 are a good starting point.

## Step 4: Prepare Your Dataset
- **Dataset Selection**: Choose a dataset. For language models, a large and diverse text dataset is crucial. You can find datasets on platforms like Kaggle or use open-source corpora.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess your data. This involves tokenization, removing special characters, and possibly lowercasing the text.

## Step 5: Fine-Tuning the Model
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt the pre-trained model to your specific dataset or task. This step involves training the model further on your dataset.
- **Training Environment**: Consider using a GPU or a cloud-based platform for training, as it can be resource-intensive.

## Step 6: Implement Training Code
- **Write Training Script**: Use Python to write a script for model training. Your script will load the model, the tokenizer, process the dataset, and then run the training loop.

## Step 7: Evaluate the Model
- **Testing**: After training, evaluate your model’s performance using a separate test dataset.
- **Metrics**: Use metrics like perplexity for language models to measure performance.

## Step 8: Deployment
- **Deployment Options**: You can deploy your model using a Flask/Django app for a web interface, or use a model serving tool like TensorFlow Serving.
- **Model Serving**: Implement an API endpoint where you can input text and receive model-generated text.

## Step 9: Optimization and Maintenance
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep track of your model's performance and make improvements as needed.
- **Update the Model**: Regularly update the model with new data or refine the model to improve accuracy.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch, Hugging Face’s Transformers
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for development, Git for version control
- **Deployment**: Flask/Django for web app, Docker for containerization, AWS/GCP for cloud deployment

## Example Code Snippet for Fine-Tuning
```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Encode text inputs
inputs = tokenizer("Your input text here", return_tensors="pt")

# Fine-tune the model
outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
loss = outputs.loss
loss.backward()
