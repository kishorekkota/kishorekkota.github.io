## Key Terminology

### Vector Embedding

Vector Embedding is a technique in machine learning and natural language processing to convert non numeric data types, such as words, sentences, or event tier document into numeric forms. Specially Vector of real numbers.

Key process with in Vector Embedding is to represent in a high dimensional space such as geometric relationship between these vectors capturing semantic relationship.

There are several methods and models for generating vector embedding - Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText among the most popular.

## What is Language Model vs Large Language Model ?


There are 2 key properties that distinguish LLms from other language models. One is Quantitative and the other is Qualitative.

- Quantitative; 10-1oo billion parameters.
- Qualitative; primarily lies in their scale, complexity, capabilities, and the resources required for their development and operation. Has enhanced capabilities that can support zero-shot learning which can generalize based on learning and can process unseen classes based on seen classes.
