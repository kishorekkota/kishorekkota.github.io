## Kafka in Enterprise Environments: Shared vs. Dedicated Infrastructure Models

## Introduction
This document aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of using Apache Kafka in a shared infrastructure model versus a dedicated infrastructure model for each team within an enterprise.

### Kafka and Multitenancy
Apache Kafka, while not inherently designed for multitenancy, possesses features that make it suitable for such a setup within an enterprise. Multitenancy in Kafka involves a single Kafka cluster being used by different systems or teams.

#### Supporting Features for Multitenancy
1. **Topic Segregation**: Organizes messages into topics for different teams or applications.
2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Controls access to specific topics.
3. **Quotas**: Sets limits on resource usage for clients or users.
4. **Scalability**: Kafka's distributed nature allows handling increased loads.
5. **Performance Isolation**: Achieved through careful planning and resource allocation.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Essential for tracking usage and diagnosing issues.

#### Challenges in Multitenancy
- **Resource Contention**: Risk of one tenantâ€™s usage impacting others.
- **Maintenance and Upgrades**: Complexity in managing without service disruption.
- **Security and Compliance**: Increased challenge in a shared environment.
